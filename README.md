# GEP Repository

This repo contains all AllianceCMS GEPs (GIFD Enhancement Proposal).

For more information regarding AllianceCMS's GEP System please refer to this documentation: https://github.com/AllianceCMS/AllianceCMS/wiki/The-GEP-System

For an explanation of the acronym GIFD (pronounced 'Gifted'), see this article: [Link](http://jbwebware.com/home/content/deciding-change-my-development-habits-now-using-gifd-methodology-pronounced-gifted)

The GEP concept is based on Python's PEPs, especially [PEP-0001](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) by Barry A. Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger.
